# Clictionary 

A lightweight dictionary which simplifies searching for words while reading or writing. Simply copy the word you need the meaning of, and the definiton, example, synonyms and antonyms will be displayed on the app display. It's made entirely with python, using tkinter, and fetches english definitions from https://dictionaryapi.dev/ . 

Currently, it supports English and Bangla(although the Bangla functionality is limited compared to it's English support).
